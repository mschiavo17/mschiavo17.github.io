          <h2 id="Meakis">Early Life</h2>
          <p>When I was younger, I had no idea that shoes even mattered. In my earliest ages, i had those shoes, but of course I didn't know what they were or what they were about. My mom bought them for me. In 7th grade, I started noticing shoes. My friends had cool shoes that were made by basketball players, like Michael Jordan and LeBron James. I got my first pair of LeBron's in 7th grade. This brought me to my interests in Jordan's and other players' shoes. </p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2 id="Meakis">Present Life</h2>
          <p>I am now 16 years old, and I have about 14 pairs of shoes that range from $90-$200. They range from Jordan's, Nike's and more. I continue to collect shoes because I like spending my money. But with that spending, I can resell them for more money, depending on the shoe. Here are images of some of my shoes.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-default" href="pix.html" role="button">View images &raquo;</a></p>
       </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2 id="Meakis">Future</h2>
          <p>In the future, I plan to keep my shoe game updated. It won't be a first priority, because I will have other, more important things to worry about. I don't know what I plan on doing as a career yet. If I somehow get rich, my shoe game will be better than it ever was. Since I dont plan on becoming rich, I will seek jobs in nursing or culinary. Then again, I'm not exactly sure yet, they're just ideas. </p>
